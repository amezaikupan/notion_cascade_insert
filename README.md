    Requirement already satisfied: notion_autolog in /app/data/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages (0.0.1)

## How to use

### Use cases

The one-to-many functionalities that we are refering to are:  
- Manufacturing: BOM → materials  
- Bakery: recipes → ingredients  
- Events: guest lists → supplies  
- Construction: projects → resources

### Building blocks

This package is built to emulate the `Notion Automation` function but
with one to many relation. Specifically, it works on the following
building blocks: 1. **TriggerDB**: monitors a database for status
changes  
2. **JunctionDB**: looks up related items and amounts  
3. **LogDB**: writes transaction logs  
4. **AutoLogger**: orchestrates the flow

We can than use them to connect to `Notion Webhook` and create the
functions that we want.

### Example

Let’s say we’re building a Bakery Inventory management database, and we
want our `Production Plan` database to automatically log the used
ingredients in a recipe that we want to make. This is a one-to-many
behavior, which Notion don’t support at the momment. For this, we would
do something like:

This will create your Ingredient Logger! Then you can set up your server
like so:
